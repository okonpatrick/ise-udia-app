Akwa Ibom Food Subsidy Initiative Website - ReadMe
Project Overview:

This website was intended to be the frontend for the Akwa Ibom Food Subsidy Initiative (SFI), a program aimed at alleviating hunger and starvation in the state. It was designed using Figma for UI mockups and implemented with React and Tailwind CSS. The backend was planned to be built using Node.js and NestJS.

Current Status:

Unfortunately, due to a change in policies, the project was abandoned. This ReadMe serves as documentation for the existing codebase.

Technology Stack:

Frontend: React, Tailwind CSS
Planned Backend: Node.js, NestJS
UI Design: Figma
Features (Planned):

Allow registration for the Social Register (if not already implemented)
Generate and manage food vouchers for beneficiaries
Display a network of redemption centers where vouchers can be used
Provide information about the program and eligibility criteria (potentially)
Notes:

The provided news article details the program's goals and Governor Eno's vision for implementation.
This codebase represents an unfinished project and may require further development to be functional.
Future Considerations:

If the project is revived, the backend needs to be developed using Node.js and NestJS.
Integration with existing government databases for the Social Register needs to be established (if applicable).
Security measures should be implemented to prevent misuse of the system.
Disclaimer:

This ReadMe provides a basic understanding of the project's purpose and current state. As the project was abandoned, the codebase might not be fully functional and may require significant work to become a production-ready application.
